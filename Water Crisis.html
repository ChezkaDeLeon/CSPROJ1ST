		<div class="text1">
			Water is most often something we take for granted. 
			We don’t realize how big the part that it plays in our everyday lives. 
			ot only do we drink a lot of water each day, we also use it for a lot of other activities like washing clothes, taking a bath, cooking, etc. 
			You might have unlimited access to both tap & drinking water 
			but did you know that at least 844 million people around the world– 1 in 8 people – lack access to safe water.

		<div class="text2 right">
			Water shortages have become common occurrences to a number of communities around the world. 
			A lack of resources and access to unpolluted, fresh water makes water an expensive frill for those who are not as fortunate to access it. 
			This means that there is no clean water for drinking or sanitation for these families and children. 
			According to the World Economic Forum, the water crisis is the #4 global risk in terms of impact to society. 
			Clean, potable water has become a luxury to over 1.1 billion people worldwide while over 2.7 billion people find water scarce for at least once a month per year.
